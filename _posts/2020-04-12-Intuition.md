## Intuition

As the name suggests, Reinforcement Learning(RL) is about learning to do a task with reinforcements. Imagine a kid learning to ride a bicycle. Nobody explicitly instructs the kid to apply say 5kN of force on the pedal, maintain your body balance on either sides of the centre of gravity, etc. Instead, he is made to ride it. While riding he may fall down and hurt himself(negative reinforcement) or he may ride it just fine and gain the appreciation(positive reinforcement) from his parents. Using these reinforcements he makes small changes in the way he rides and finally learns it.
